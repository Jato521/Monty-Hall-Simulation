                <p>
                    The Monty Hall problem is named for 
                    its similarity to the Let's Make a Deal television game show
                    hosted by Monty Hall. The problem is stated as follows. 
                    Assume that a room is equipped with three doors. 
                    Behind two are goats, and behind the third is a shiny new car. 
                    You are asked to pick a door, and will win whatever is behind it. 
                    Let's say you pick door 1. Before the door is opened, 
                    however, someone who knows what's behind the doors (Monty Hall) 
                    opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat, and asks you if 
                    you wish to change your selection to the third door 
                    (i.e., the door which neither you picked nor he opened). 
                    The Monty Hall problem is deciding whether you do.

                    The correct answer is that you do want to switch. 
                    If you do not switch, you have the expected 1/3 chance 
                    of winning the car, since no matter whether you initially 
                    picked the correct door, Monty will show you a door with a 
                    goat. But after Monty has eliminated one of the doors 
                    for you, you obviously do not improve your chances of 
                    winning to better than 1/3 by sticking with your original 
                    choice. If you now switch doors, however, there is a 2/3 
                    chance you will win the car (counterintuitive though it seems).
